This extension very deliberately cherry-picks the individual terms\n from Schema.org that Inrupt currently deem generally useful for Solid and Solid\n applications (meaning we can provide a much cleaner, less noisy and smaller\n bundle size when generating programming language artifacts that provide\n convenient constants for just these selected terms, rather than including the\n over 2,500 terms currently defined in Schema.org).\n\n - vcard: [Generator provided] - vCard - for describing People and Organizations\n\n - vcard-inrupt-ext: [Generator provided] - vCard with selective terms having translations - for describing People and Organizations\n\n - rdf: [Generator provided] - RDF (Resource Description Framework) - a framework for representing information in the Web\n\n - rdf-inrupt-ext: [Generator provided] - RDF (Resource Description Framework) with selective terms having translations - a framework for representing information in the Web\n\n - rdfs: [Generator provided] - RDFS (RDF Schema) - a data-modelling vocabulary for RDF data\n\n - xsd: A vocabulary for describing XML Schema datatypes.\n\n - owl: [Generator provided] - OWL (Web Ontology Language) - a Semantic Web language designed to represent rich and complex knowledge about things, groups of things, and relations between things\n\n - ldp: Vocabulary URIs defined in the Linked Data Platform (LDP) namespace.\n\n - http: [Generator provided] - HTTP Ontology - terms from the HTTP protocol\n\n - httph: [Generator provided] - HTTPH Ontology - for describing the common HTTP headers. Namespace document is extremely sparse (as of Aug 2019), so extended\n\n - olo: [Generator provided] - OLO (Ordered List Ontology) - for describing ordered lists\n\n - skos: An RDF vocabulary for describing the basic structure and content of concept schemes such as thesauri, classification schemes, subject heading lists, taxonomies, &#x27;folksonomies&#x27;, other types of controlled vocabulary, and also concept schemes embedded in glossaries and terminologies.\n\n - ui: Extension to UI terms providing multilingual alternative names and translations for comments (e.g. for use directly as labels or tool-tips in user interfaces or error messages)\n\n - vann: A vocabulary for annotating vocabulary descriptions (VANN).\n\n - dcterms: [Generator provided] - Dublin Core Terms - for describing resources\n\n - as: [Generator provided] - Activity Streams 2.0 - for representing potential and completed activities\n\n - rlog: Inrupt-created copy of RLOG, needed due to Server 500 errors resolving original uni-leipzig.org!\n\n - foaf: [Generator provided] - Friend of a friend, v0.99\n\n - qb: [Generator provided] - The RDF Data Cube Vocabulary\n\n - sdmx-dimension: [Generator provided] - SDMX Dimension Vocabulary\n\n - shex: [Generator provided] - Shape Expressions (ShEx) - for validating RDF\n\n - acl: [Generator provided] - Web Access Control Vocabulary\n\n - posix: A vocabulary for the basic POSIX terms.\n\n - ical: [Generator provided] - iCal - a vocabulary for description of events and calendars\n\n - prov-o: [Generator provided] - W3C Provenance Ontology (just the main prov-o terms)",
